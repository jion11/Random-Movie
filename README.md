# Random-Movie

TODO (Will be continued when I return lest I face the wrath of Herve)


Create a connection pool to handle more clients at a time.

Make the tabs work so that the different things (movielist, randomizer, watched) have their own place

Have a button that randomizes the movie rather than refreshing

A way to decide if randomized movie gets added to watch list (Did you watch it or not)

add pictures to match the movie (?)

Style it so that it looks all pretty

Code review
